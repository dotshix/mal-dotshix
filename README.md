# mal - Make a Lisp (Rust Implementation)

## Description

This is a Rust implementation of Mal, a Clojure-inspired Lisp interpreter created as part of the Make-a-Lisp (mal) project. The project structure is based on Joel Martinâ€™s [mal repository](https://github.com/kanaka/mal), which serves as an educational tool for learning Lisp implementation.

## Implementation Steps

Following the structure of the original mal project, this Rust implementation progresses through a series of incremental steps, each adding new functionality and concepts essential to building a Lisp interpreter:

1. ~~**REPL**~~
2. ~~**Read and Print**~~
3. ~~**Evaluation**~~
4. ~~**Environment Management**~~
5. ~~**Special Forms and Functions**~~
6. **Tail Call Optimization**
7. **File Handling**
8. **Quoting**
9. **Macros**
10. **Error Handling**
11. **Self-hosting Capabilities**

Each step builds on the previous one, leading to a complete, self-hosting Lisp interpreter.

## Credits

This Rust implementation is inspired by the original [mal](https://github.com/kanaka/mal) project by Joel Martin, which provides an educational framework and test suite for developing a Lisp interpreter.
